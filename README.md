# Project-6
Data collection and sharing (statistics in sociology)
Find 10 respondents and ask them to read the above description (or read it to them yourself, whichever they choose), and then ask them these questions:

1) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 1 (difference-denying feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

2) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 2 (difference-removing feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree"), what number would you pick?

3) If you wanted to approximate your degree of agreement with approach 3 (difference-honoring feminism) by picking a number from 1 to 10 (1 being "strongly disagree" and 10 being "strongly agree") what number would you pick?

4) Which of these three approaches do you think has had the most cultural and political impact in the past few decades ("most" in terms of magnitude, not quality, that is, we don't mean "best", just magnitude)?

5) Are you or have been a mother?
